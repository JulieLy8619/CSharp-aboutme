# About Me

This is a simple program that asks 5 questions about me and takes in your guesses and tells you the correct answer.
No one else would want to use this at this time because it was just an assignment to practice coding a few new topics (like TRY blocks)

## Installing / Getting started

<!--I'm not sure what to fill in here. Like that they need to install VS? Then open the SLN file? -->

When you run the program, it should auto prompt you a question and then it records your answer. It will then inform you of the correct answer regardless if you got it right or wrong. This will repeat 5 times in total.

### Initial Configuration

There are no needed configurations.

## Developing

```shell
git clone https://github.com/JulieLy8619/lab01-aboutme.git
cd lab01-aboutme/
open Program.cs and modify code
```

This will get a copy of my repo on your local machine and allow you to drill into the code to modify it.
