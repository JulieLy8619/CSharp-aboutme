# About Me

This is a simple Console Application program that asks 5 questions about me and takes in your guesses and tells you the correct answer.
No one else would want to use this at this time because it was just an assignment to practice coding a few new topics (like returning different types and TRY blocks)

## Installing / Getting started

<!--Do I need to state they need to install VS? -->
You will need Visual Studio 2017 (I used Communicty), you can install it at the following link if you need: 
https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/?utm_medium=microsoft&utm_source=docs.microsoft.com&utm_campaign=button+cta&utm_content=download+vs2017

When you run the program, it should auto prompt you a question and then it records your answer. It will then inform you of the correct answer regardless if you got it right or wrong. This will repeat 5 times in total.

### Initial Configuration

There are no needed configurations.

## Developing

```shell
git clone https://github.com/JulieLy8619/lab01-aboutme.git
cd lab01-aboutme/
```

Then open Program.cs

This will get a copy of my repo on one's local machine and allow one to drill into the code to modify it.
